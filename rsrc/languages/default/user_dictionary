## You can add your own words to this user dictionary.
## For example, some proper nouns will not appear in the standard dictionary.
## Also strange, "cartoony" words will likely not appear.
##
## Each entry must be on its own line in the file. First is the word as normally written.
## Next, the word is followed by the phonemes used to pronounce it.
## These must be CMU-style phonemes, not Preston Blair phonemes. The CMU phonemes are more
## complex, but also more complete. Using CMU phonemes will also allow Papagayo to map them
## to other phoneme sets in the future.
##
## To start with, there is just one sample entry in this dictionary, WOWZA.
